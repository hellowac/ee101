About the Author

Darren Coy Ashby 自称是一个“留着尖头头发的技术怪咖”。他自认是个样样通、样样松的人。他认为自己的常识来自父亲，而书本知识则来自母亲。他在农场长大，似乎很久以前毕业于犹他州立大学。Darren 拥有超过 20 年在现实世界中作为技术员、工程师和管理者的工作经验。他曾涉足合规、生产、测试等多个领域，而他最钟爱的还是研发。

数年前，Darren 抓住机会在母校教了几个学期的课程。他还曾在在线杂志 Chipcenter.com 上定期撰稿近两年。目前他是某年营收达十亿美元的消费品公司的电子研发主管。他的兴趣包括船只、雪地摩托、摩托车，以及几乎所有带马达的东西。在不上班的时候，他大多数时间都与家人共度，或投入到几年前创办的一家前景可期的研发顾问/制造公司中。

Darren 与他美丽的妻子、四个健壮的儿子和一个可爱的女儿一起，住在犹他州里士满靠近群山的地方。他相信“纵火狂热”与成为伟大工程师密切相关，并专门为此在 Facebook™ 上建立了一个页面。你可以通过 dashby@raddd.com 给他发邮件，提出意见、投诉或随意交流；如果你只想看看他的一些智慧片段，也可以在 Twitter™ 上关注他，用户名是 sparkyguru。

    Darren Coy Ashby is a self-described “techno geek with pointy hair.” He considers himself a jack-of-all-trades, master of none. He figures his common sense came from his dad and his book sense from his mother. Raised on a farm and graduated from Utah State University seemingly ages ago, Darren has more than 20 years of experience in the real world as a technician, an engineer, and a manager. He has worked in diverse areas of compliance, production, testing, and his personal favorite, research and development.

    Darren jumped at a chance some years back to teach a couple of semesters at his alma mater. For about two years, he wrote regularly for the online magazine Chipcenter.com. He is currently the director of electronics R&D at a billion- dollar consumer products company. His passions are boats, snowmobiles, motorcycles, and pretty much anything with a motor. When not at his day job, he spends most of his time with his family and a promising R&D consulting/ manufacturing firm he started a couple of years ago.

    Darren lives with his beautiful wife, four strapping boys, and cute little daughter next to the mountains in Richmond, Utah. He believes pyromania goes hand in hand with becoming a great engineer and has dedicated a FacebookTM page to that topic. You can email him with comments, complaints, and general ruminations at dashby@raddd.com; if all you want are tidbits of wisdom you can follow him on TwitterTM under sparkyguru.
