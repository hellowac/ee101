CHAPTER 5 Tools
================

What tools to use and when to use them? That is the proverbial question. There
are innumerable tools available to the electrical engineer. This chapter is not
intended to be an exhaustive analysis of various tools but rather a guideline
for selecting the proper tool and for setting it up right to get the information
you are looking for.

MAKING THE INVISIBLE VISIBLE
------------------------------

One difficulty that electrical engineers have in general is that the electrons they
work with are not something you can pick up, touch, or feel. (Okay, I take back
the feel part—there are definitely voltage levels that you can feel!) In reality,
you infer the electrons’ existence based on how they affect objects. You don’t
see the current flowing in a light bulb; you see the heat generated by the current
flowing in a light bulb. Given this, tools that can measure various attributes of
electricity are invaluable in electrical engineering.

Meters
~~~~~~~~~

Ahh, the lowly meter—probably the tool you will use most often in your quest
for electrical engineering excellence. Most meters you will encounter today fall
into the DMM (digital multimeter) category (see Figure 5.1).
The first rule of thumb in using a meter (and this applies generally to all the tools
you use) is to have some idea of what you are looking for. For example, if you
are trying to read an AC signal, don’t set your meter to DC. This might sound
overly simplistic, but I believe that poor tool setup is the most common mistake
made by the average engineer. You can extrapolate from this rule to solve other
misreading problems. This leads to a second rule and a case in point. The rule:
Don’t trust auto setups implicitly. The case in point was a motor voltage we were
trying to read; the voltage across the motor was a PWM signal with a peak of
140 V. We were trying to read the average voltage across this motor with a Fluke
87, but the readings didn’t make sense (note the application of rule one). We
found that when the meter was in auto-range mode, the brain of the meter
