CHAPTER 2 Basic Theory
==========================

Every discipline has fundamentals that are used to extrapolate all the other, more complex ideas. Basics are the most important thing you can know. It is knowledge of the basics that helps you apply all that stuff in your head cor- rectly. It doesn’t matter if you can handle quadratic equations and calculus in your sleep. If you don’t grasp the basics, you will find yourself constantly chas- ing a problem in circles without resolution. If you get anything out of this text, make sure that you really understand the basics!


OHM’S LAW STILL WORKS: CONSTANTLY DRILL THE FUNDAMENTALS
----------------------------------------------------------

Ohm’s Law
~~~~~~~~~~~

This, I believe, is one of the best-taught principles in school for the budding engineer or technician, and it should be. So why go over it? Well, two reasons come to mind: One, you can’t go over the basics too much, and two, though any engineer can quote Ohm’s Law by heart, I have often seen it ignored in application.

First, let’s state Ohm’s Law: Voltage equals current multiplied by resistance; it is shown in :ref:`Figure 2.1 <Figure 2.1>`.

It is simple, but do you consider that resistance exists in every part of a circuit? [1]_ It is easy to forget that, especially since many simulators do. I think the best way to drive this point home is to recount the way it was driven home to me.

.. note::

    There I was—a lowly engineering student. I was working as a technician or associate engineer (depending on whom you asked). I was arguing with my boss, who had an MSEE degree, but he just wouldn’t believe me; neither would my lead engineer (who had a BSEE). I couldn’t bring myself to distrust Ohm’s Law, even in light of their “superior”

.. [1] Okay, you could be all snitty here and point out that superconductors by definition don’t have resistance. But then my cool story coming up wouldn’t have the impact needed to drive home this point that applies to 99.999999% of all circuits out there!

.. _Figure 2.1:

    knowledge. I’d had less heated debates with rabid dogs. This was the problem: Our department needed to measure the current of a DC motor that could range from 5 A to 15 A at any given time, but our multi-meters had a 10 A fuse in the current measuring circuit.

    So, using Ohm’s Law (which was fresh in my mind, being a student and all), I designed a shunt to measure current. I wanted to get a good reading but disturb the circuit as little as possible, so I chose a 0.1 Ω resistor. I built a box to house it and installed banana-jack plugs to provide an easy interface to a voltmeter. The design looked like the one shown in :ref:`Figure 2.2 <Figure 2.2>`.

    .. _Figure 2.2:

    .. figure:: ./img/f2.2.png
        :scale: 50%
        :align: center

        **FIGURE 2.2 Original design of simple current-measuring circuit.**

    Everyone thought it was a great idea, so I built a couple of boxes and we started using them right away. After a while, however, we noticed that they were not very accurate. Sometimes they would be off by as much as 50 to 60%. No one could figure out why, so I sat down to analyze what I had created.

    After a few minutes, I said to myself, “Well, duh!” I realized that to make the assembly easy I had soldered the wires from the motor to the banana jacks and then soldered some short 14-gauge jumpers to the shunt resistor. My circuit really looked like the drawing shown in :ref:`Figure 2.3 <Figure 2.3>`.

    .. _Figure 2.3:

    .. figure:: ./img/f2.3.png
        :scale: 50%
        :align: center

        **FIGURE 2.3 As-built simple current-measuring circuit.**

    My voltmeter was measuring across a larger resistance value than 0.1 ohms. Wire has resistance, too; even a couple of inches of 14-gauge wire has a few hundredths of an ohm. Remembering Ohm’s Law:

    .. math::
        :label: equation 2.1

        V = I * R

    I realized that this means if you increase R, you get more V for the same amount of current, leading to the errors we were seeing. I had made a simple mistake that fortunately was easy to correct. I redesigned the box on paper to look like the drawing in :ref:`Figure 2.4 <Figure 2.4>`.

    .. _Figure 2.4:

    .. figure:: ./img/f2.4.png
        :scale: 50%
        :align: center

        **FIGURE 2.4 Redesigned current-measuring circuit.**

    I took this to my boss (the one with the MSEE who could do math in his head that I would only attempt with MathCad and a cold drink). His reaction floored me. He reviewed it with the lead engineer and they came to the conclusion that I was completely wrong. They were talking about things like temperature coefficients and phase shifts in current and RMS and a bunch of other topics that were over my head at the time. Thus began the argument. I explained that two points on a schematic had to be connected by a wire and a wire had resistance. Though it is often ignored, it was significant in this case because the shunt resistor was such a small value.

    As they hemmed and hawed over this, I learned that many times it is human nature to ignore what one learned long ago and try to apply more advanced theories just because you know them. Also, all the knowledge in the world isn’t worth jack if it is incorrectly applied. I continued to press my point. I must have written Ohm’s Law on the white board 50 times by then.


    They finally conceded and agreed that the extra wire between the banana jack and the shunt was the cause of the error. That was not the end of the disagreement, though. How in the world was my new design going to fix the problem by simply repositioning the wires? The resistance was still in the circuit, was it not? I wrote down Ohm’s Law another

    100 times and explained that the current through the meter was very small, making the resistance in the wire insignificant again. My astonishment reached new levels as I observed the human ability to overlook the obvious. The first argument was nothing compared to this one. The fireworks really started to fly then.

    What is the moral of this story? Well, Scott Adams, creator of Dilbert, said, “Everyone has moments of stupidity,” as he watched someone fix his “broken” pager by putting in a new battery. I have to agree with him. I rediscover Ohm’s Law about every 6 months. Always, always, always check the basics before you start looking for more complicated solutions! My father, a mechanic, tells a story of rewiring an entire car just to find a bad fuse. (It looked okay, but he didn’t check out with a meter.) That was how he learned this lesson. Me, I just participated in 4 hours of the dumbest argument of my career.

    How did the argument end? We never came to an agreement, so I went ahead and fixed boxes with the new design anyway (which they spent several weeks proving were working correctly). I didn’t say another word but transferred out of that group as soon as possible. The same design has been in use for more than 10 years now, and the documentation notes the need to wire it correctly to avoid inaccurate readings. I didn’t write that document, my old boss did. It’s kind of funny how we didn’t argue about Ohm’s Law after that.

The basics are the most important; let me repeat that, the basics are important! Ohm’s Law is the most basic principle you will use as an electrical engineer. It is the foundation on which all other rules are based. The fundamental fact is that resistance impedes current flow. This impedance creates a voltage drop across the resistor that is proportional to the amount of current flowing through it. If it helps, you can think of a resistor as a current-to-voltage converter. [2]_

With that important point made, let’s consider two other types of impedance that can be found in a circuit. We will get into this in more detail later, but for now consider that inductors and capacitors both can act like resistors, depending on the frequency of the signal. If you take this into account, Ohm’s Law still works when applied to these components as well. You could very well rewrite the equation to:

.. math::
   :label: equation 2.2

    V = I * Z

.. [2] If you don’t get the idea of a current-to-voltage converter, think about it a bit harder, put current through a resistor, get a voltage drop across it out—hopefully deep thought on this will lead to one of those “light-bulb-over-the-head” moments when it all seems to make sense.

Think of the impedance Z as resistance at a given frequency. [3]_ As we move on to the other basic equations, keep this in mind. Wherever you see resistance in an equation, you can simply replace it with impedance if you consider the fre- quency of the signal.

One final note: Every wire, trace, component, or material in your circuit has these three components in it—resistance, inductance, and capacitance. Everything has resistance, everything has capacitance, and everything has inductance. The most important question you must ask is, “Is it enough to make a difference?” The fact is, in my own experience, if the shunt resistor had been 100 times larger, that would have made the errors we were seeing 100 times less. [4]_ They would have been insignificant in comparison to the measurement we were taking. The impe- dance equations for capacitors and inductors will help you in a similar way. Con- sider the frequencies you are operating at and ask yourself, “Is this component making a significant impact on what I am looking at?” By reviewing this signifi- cance, you will be able to pinpoint the part of the circuit you are looking for.

The experience I related earlier happened years ago at the beginning of my career, and I said then that I still rediscover Ohm’s Law every six months. Time and time again, working through a problem or design, the answer can be found by application of Ohm’s Law. So, before you break out all those higher theories trying to solve a problem, first remember: Ohm’s Law still works!

Next on our list of basic formulae is the voltage divider rule. Here is the equation and :ref:`Figure 2.5 <Figure 2.5>` shows a schematic of the circuit:

.. math::
   :label: equation 2.3

    Vo = Vi \frac{Rg}{Rg + Ri}

The most common way you will see this is in terms of R1 and R2. I have changed these to Rg (for R ground) and Ri (for R input) to remind myself which one of these goes to ground and which one is in series. If you get them backward, you get the amount of voltage lost across Ri, not the amount at the output (which is the voltage across Rg). If the gain [5]_ of this circuit just doesn’t seem right, you might have the two values swapped.

.. [3] Okay, this is a bit oversimplified; it acts like resistance in one sense, but it does so by causing a delay in the phase of the signal. I have found that in most cases thinking of it like this will give you a decent idea of what is going on. Just remember it isn’t exactly like a resistor dependent on frequency; it merely acts like one.
.. [4] Here’s a fun question for you to figure out: If I had used a resistor 100 times larger, what would have been the ramifications of that? What wattage of resistor would I have needed? Would that have affected the operation of the device under measurement? If so, how much, and why? I have found that the brightest engineers will throw a problem like this up on the white board and dig into it, arguing the finer points until their boss comes along and says, “Okay, enough fun, time to get back to work.”
.. [5] One way I like to think of this is Vo=Vi*H, where H is the gain of the circuit, or H=Rg/ðRg + RiÞ: This is useful when you are breaking a circuit down to components. We will specifically use this when we discuss op-amps later on.

.. _Figure 2.5:

.. figure:: ./img/f2.5.png
    :scale: 50%
    :align: center

    **FIGURE 2.5 Input voltage is divided down at the output.**

You might also notice that the gain of this circuit is never greater than 1. It approaches 1 as Ri goes to 0, and it approaches 1 as Rg gets very large. (Note that as Rg gets larger, the value of Ri becomes less significant.) Since this is the case, it is easy to think of the voltage divider as a circuit that passes a per- centage of the voltage through to the output. When you look at this circuit, try to think of it in terms of percentage. For example, if Rg = Ri, only 50% of the voltage would be present on the output. If you want 10% of the signal, you will need a gain of 1/10. So put 1K in for Rg, and 9K in for Ri, and voilà, you have a voltage divider that leaves 10% of the signal at the output.

Did you notice that the ratio of the resistors to each other was 1:9 for a gain of 1/10? This is because the denominator is the sum of the two resistor values. I’ll also bet you noticed that if you swap the two resistor values you will get a gain of 9/10, or 90%. This should make intuitive sense to you now if you recognize that, for the same amount of current, the voltage drop across a 9 K Ri will be 9 times larger than the voltage drop across a 1 K Rg. In other words, 90% of the voltage is across Ri, whereas 10% of the voltage is across Rg, where your meter measuring Vo is hooked up. The voltage divider is really just an extension of Ohm’s Law (go figure), but it is so useful that I’ve included it as one of the basic equations that you should commit to memory.


Capacitors Impede Changes in Voltage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let’s consider for a moment what might happen to the previous voltage divider circuit if we replace Rg with a capacitor. It is still a voltage divider circuit, is it not? But what is the difference? At this point you should say, “Hey, a cap is just a resistor (or more correctly impedance) whose value changes depending on the frequency; wouldn’t that make this a voltage divider that depends on frequency?” Well, it does, and this is commonly known as an RC circuit. Let’s draw one now, as shown in :ref:`Figure 2.6 <Figure 2.6>`.

.. _Figure 2.6:

.. figure:: ./img/f2.6.png
    :scale: 50%
    :align: center

    **FIGURE 2.6 Step input is applied to a simple RC circuit.**

Using your intuitive understanding of resistors and capacitors, let’s analyze what is going to happen in this circuit. We’ll do this by applying a step input. A step input is by definition a fast change in voltage. The resistor doesn’t care about the change in voltage, but the cap does. This fast change in voltage can be thought of as high frequencies, [6]_ and how does the cap respond to high frequencies? That’s right, it has low impedance. So, now we apply the voltage divider rule. If the impedance of Rg is low (as compared to Ri), the voltage at Vo is low. As frequency drops, the impedance goes up; as the impedance goes up, based on the voltage divider, the output voltage goes up. Where does it all stop?

Think about it a moment. Based on what you know about a cap, it resists a change in voltage. A quick change in voltage is what happened initially. After that our step input remained at 5 V, not changing anymore. Doesn’t it make sense that the cap will eventually charge to 5 V and stay there? This phenomenon is known as the transient response of an RC circuit. The change in voltage on the output of this circuit has a characteristic curve. It is described by this equation (note t = time):

.. math::
   :label: equation 2.4

    Vo = Vi \left ( 1 - e^{- \frac{t}{rc}}  \right )

The graph of this output looks like :ref:`Figure 2.7 <Figure 2.7>`. The value of R times C in this equation is also known as tau, or the time constant, often referred to by the Greek letter τ.

.. math::
   :label: equation 2.5

    RC = \tau

For a step input, this curve is always the same for an RC circuit. The only thing that changes is the amount of time it takes to get to the final value. The shape of the curve is always the same, but the time it takes to happen depends on the value of the time constant [7]_ τ. You can normalize this curve in terms of the time constant and the final value of the voltage. Let’s redraw the curve with multiples of τ along the time axis, as shown in :ref:`Figure 2.8 <Figure 2.8>`.

At 1 τ the voltage reaches 63.2%, at 2 τ it is at 86.6%, 3 τ is 95%, by 4 τ it is at 98%, and when you reach 5 τ you are close enough to 100% to consider it so.

.. [6] This is something a man named Fourier thought of long ago. The more harmonic frequencies you sum together, the faster the rise time of said step input.

.. [7] If you stop to think about it, it just makes sense that this value RC is called a time constant, since it affects the timing of the response.

.. _Figure 2.7:

.. figure:: ./img/f2.7.png
    :scale: 50%
    :align: center

    **FIGURE 2.7 Voltage change over time.**

.. _Figure 2.8:

.. figure:: ./img/f2.8.png
    :scale: 50%
    :align: center

    **FIGURE 2.8 Voltage change in percentage over time in tau.**

This response curve describes a basic and fundamental principle in electronics. Some years ago I started asking potential job candidates to draw this curve after I gave them the RC circuit shown in Figure 2.6. Over the years I have been dis- mayed at how many engineers, both fresh out of school and with years of experience, cannot draw this curve. Fewer than 50% of the applicants I have asked can do it. That fact is one of the main reasons I decided to write this book. (The other was that someone was actually willing to pay me to do it! I doubt it would have gotten far otherwise.) So, I implore you to put this to memory once and for all; by doing so I guarantee you will be a better engineer. Plus, if I ever interview you, you will have a 50% better chance of getting a job! If you understand this concept, you will understand inductors, as you will see in the next section.

Before we move on, I would like you to consider what happens to the current in this circuit. Remember Ohm’s Law? Apply it to this example to understand what the current does. We know that:


.. math::
   :label: equation 2.6

    V = I * R

A little algebra turns this equation into:

.. math::
   :label: equation 2.7

    I = \frac{V}{R}

A little common sense reveals that the voltage across R in this circuit is equal to voltage at the output minus voltage at the input. As an equation, you get:

.. math::
   :label: equation 2.8

    Vr = Vi - Vo

.. _Figure 2.9:

.. figure:: ./img/f2.9.png
    :scale: 50%
    :align: center

    **FIGURE 2.9 Current change in percentage over time in tau.**

We know the voltage at each point in time in terms of tau. At 0 τ, Vo is at 0. So the full 5 V is across the resistor and the maximum current is flowing. For all intents and purposes, the cap is shorting the output to ground at this point in time. At 1 τ, Vo is at 63.2% of Vi. That means Vr is at 36.8% of Vi. Repeat this process, connect the dots, and you get a curve that moves in the opposite direction of the voltage curve, something like what’s shown in :ref:`Figure 2.9 <Figure 2.9>`.

Notice how current can change immediately when the step input changes. Also notice how the voltage just doesn’t change that fast. Capacitors impede a change in voltage, as the rule goes. What this also means is that changes in current [8]_ will not be affected at all. Everything has its opposite, and capacitors are no exception, so let’s move on to inductors.


Inductors Impede Changes in Current
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that we have thought through the RC circuit, let’s consider the RL circuit shown in :ref:`Figure 2.10 <Figure 2.10>`. Remember that the inductor resists a change in current but not in voltage. Initially, with the same step input, the voltage at the output can jump right to 5 V. Current through the inductor is initially at 0, but now there is a voltage drop across it, so current has to start climbing. The current responds in the RL circuit exactly the same way voltage responds in the RC circuit.

Since you committed the RC response to memory, the RL response is easy. It is exactly the same from the viewpoint of current; [9]_ the current graph looks like :ref:`Figure 2.11 <Figure 2.11>`.

.. [8] Another way to think of it is that rapid changes in current are what capacitors are very good at.
.. [9] Being able to consider a circuit from either a “voltage” viewpoint or a “current” viewpoint is a valuable skill. Try to formulate an understanding of this concept as you develop your skills in this area.

I hope you are saying to yourself, “What about the voltage response?” At this time, consider Ohm’s Law for a moment and try to graph what the voltage will do. What is the current at time 0? How about a little later? Remember Ohm’s Law—for the current to be low, resistance must be high. So initially the inductor acts like an open circuit. Voltage across the inductor will be at the same value as the input. As time goes on, the impedance of the inductor drops off, becoming a short, so voltage drops as well. :ref:`Figure 2.12 <Figure 2.12>` shows the graph.

The inductor is the exact complement of the capacitor. What it does to current, the cap does to voltage, and vice versa.

Series and Parallel Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two ways for components to be configured in a circuit: series and parallel. Series components line up one after another; parallel components are hooked up next to each other. Let’s go over the formulas to simplify these component arrangements.

Series resistors, shown :ref:`Figure 2.13 <Figure 2.13>`, are easy; you simply add them up, no multiplication needed!


.. math::
   :label: equation 2.9

   Rt = R1 + R2 + R3

The inductors shown in :ref:`Figure 2.14 <Figure 2.14>` are like resistors—you sum series inductors the same way.

.. math::
   :label: equation 2.10

    Lt = L1 + L2 + L3

Remember that capacitors are the opposite of inductors. For this reason, capacitors must be in parallel to be summed up the way resistors and inductors are in series; see :ref:`Figure 2.15 <Figure 2.15>`.

.. math::
   :label: equation 2.11

    Ct = C1 + C2 + C3

Remember the equivalences shown in :ref:`Figure 2.16 <Figure 2.16>`.

Parallel resistors, shown in :ref:`Figure 2.17 <Figure 2.17>`, are a little trickier. The equivalent resis- tance of any two components is determined by the product of the values divided by the sum of the values. [10]_

Keep in mind, however, that this works for any two resistors! In the case of three resistors or more, solve any two and repeat until done. (The ``//`` means **in parallel with**.)

.. math::
   :label: equation 2.12

    R1 // R2 = \frac{R1 * R2}{R1 + R2}  \space\space\space\space Rt = \frac{R1 // R2 * R3}{R1 // R2 + R3}

.. math::
   :label: equation 2.13

    L1 // L2 = \frac{L1 * L2}{L1 + L2}  \space\space\space\space Lt = \frac{L1 // L2 * L3}{L1 // L2 + L3}

Parallel inductors are the same as resistors; you can reduce them in the same way—see :ref:`Figure 2.18 <Figure 2.18>`.

.. [10] Another way to remember this idea is to sum all the inverses: ``1/Rt = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3``, and so on. If this works better for you, that is fine, just commit one or the other to memory.

    :align: center

    **FIGURE 2.20 Component equivalents.**

For capacitors the same equation applies, but only if they are in series, as shown in :ref:`Figure 2.19 <Figure 2.19>`. These are the circuits that use the product-over-the-sum, or the sum-of-the-inverses, rule; [11]_ see :ref:`Figure 2.20 <Figure 2.20>`.

.. math::
   :label: equation 2.14

    C1 // C2 = \frac{C1 * C2}{C1 + C2}  \space\space\space\space Ct = \frac{C1 // C2 * C3}{C1 // C2 + C3}

In dealing with parallel and series circuits, you can see that there are only two types of equations. One is simple addition, and the other is the product over the sum (or the sum of inverses). The only trick is to know which to use when. Remember that the resistor and inductor are part of the “in” crowd and the cap is the outcast wallflower who is the opposite of those other guys. I’ll bet most engineers can relate to being the “capacitor” at a party, so this shouldn’t be too hard to remember!

.. [11] You can sum the inverses of the capacitors or inductors in the same way as the resistors. Just put impedance in place of resistance: ``1/Zt = 1/Z1 + 1/Z2 + 1/Z3``, and so on. Truth be told, I committed the product-over-the-sum rule to memory many years ago. That’s why I like it. You can be just as effective with the sum of the inverses rule, as so many astute readers have pointed out. I hope you have realized by now that if there are two equivalent routes to get to a destination, I don’t particularly care which one you use so long as you get to the right place. I do believe that it is important to find what works for you and focus on that. Don’t worry about going a different way unless it gives you new insight or understanding. Wow, this just might be the longest footnote in the whole book! Maybe I should add just a few more words to make sure. If you do read this and make it all the way to the end without nodding off, drop me a line at dashby@raddd.com and let me know. I answer every piece of fan mail I get, so I will surely reply. If you inspire a profound thought in our exchange I will tweet it out into the nether regions of the Internet and see if I can inspire anyone to follow sparkyguru. :D BTW, I really like to hear pyromanic stories so if you send me a really good one it will end up on my Facebook pyromanics = engineers group. Whew! There, did I hit all the new media outlets a guy has to these days just to be in the know? LOL!


Thevenin’s Theorem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Thevenizing is based on the idea of using super- position to analyze a circuit. When you have two different variables affecting an equation, making it difficult to analyze, you can use the technique of superposition to solve the equa- tion, provided that you are dealing with linear equations (by luck all these basic components are linear; even if you might not think it when looking at the curve of an RC time response, it actually is a linear equation). [12]_

The idea of superposition is simple: When you have multiple inputs affecting an output, you can analyze the effects of each input indepen- dently and add them together when you are all done to see what the output does. One idea that comes from superposition is *Thevenin’s theorem*.

.. _Figure 2.21:

.. figure:: ./img/f2.21.png
    :scale: 50%
    :align: center

    **FIGURE 2.21 Circuit with two voltage sources.**

Using Thevenin’s theorem allows you to reduce basically any circuit into a vol- tage divider. And we know how to solve a voltage divider, don’t we! There is a sister theorem called Norton’s, which does the same thing but is based on cur- rent rather than voltage. Since you can solve any electrical problem with either equation, I suggest you focus on one or the other. Since I like to think in terms of voltage, I prefer Thevenizing a circuit to the Norton equivalent. So to be true to the idea that you should only learn a few fundamentals and learn those well, we will focus on Thevenin equivalents.

The most important rule when Thevenizing is this: Voltage sources [13]_ are shorted, current sources are opened. Consider the circuit shown in :ref:`Figure 2.21 <Figure 2.21>`. [14]_

Once all the voltage sources are shorted and all the current sources are opened, all the components will be in series or parallel. That makes it very convenient for those of us who only want to memorize a few equations! Apply those basic parallel and series rules we just learned and voilà, you have a circuit that is much easier to understand. Once you have reduced the resistors, inductors, and caps to a more controllable number, you replace each source one at a time to see the effects of each source on the com- ponent in question.

.. [12] When I see the term linear equation, I think line, so an RC curve seems counterintuitive, but linear equations are a type of formula that allows certain rules such as superposition to be used.
.. [13] Note the use of the word source; a voltage source is a device that keeps the voltage constant as a load varies. A current source keeps the current constant in the face of a changing load.
.. [14] This circuit sparked a competition in the last edition of this book (since I didn’t bother to include a solution). Rather than try to show you how smart I am by including a solution in this edition, I am going to change a few values (or maybe not) and invite you as readers to solve this circuit. Drop me a note with your solution; I promise you will win an all-expense-paid email back from me congratulating you on your engineering prowess!

I find it helps when Thevenizing a circuit to try to imagine that you are looking back into the circuit from the output. This means that you imagine what the circuit looks like in terms of the output. We often think in terms of stuff that goes in the input. Something goes in, something happens, and then it comes out the out- put. Try flipping that notion on its head. Think, “Here is the output, what exactly is it hooked up to? What are the impedances that the cap in this case ’sees’ connected to it?” Once you are able to adjust your point of view, Thevenizing will become an even more powerful tool. Consider the circuit shown in :ref:`Figure 2.22 <Figure 2.22>`.

This circuit comes from a real, live application. I would tell you what, but it is secret. [15]_ So we won’t say this is anything more than a voltage divider with a capa- citive filter on it. (Values might have been changed to protect the innocent.)

This circuit’s job is to lower a voltage at the input terminals varying from 0 to 100 V to something with a range of 0 to 5 V. The input voltage also has an AC component that is filtered out by the capacitor. The question is, what is the time constant of the RC filter in this circuit?

Is it 500 K*0.1 μf? That’s what I would have thought before I understood The- venin’s theorem. The output in this case is the voltage across the cap, so let’s look back into the circuit to figure out what is hooked up to this cap. Now remember, I said there was a voltage source on the input of this circuit. Let’s short that on our drawing and Thevenize it. Take a look at the Thevenized circuit shown in :ref:`Figure 2.23 <Figure 2.23>`.

Hopefully at this point something really jumped out at you. The 10 K and the 500 K resistors are in parallel as far as the cap is concerned. Applying the rule of parallel resistors we find that the resistance hooked up to this cap is 9.8 K. Wow, that is a lot less than 500 K, isn’t it! Thevenizing showed us that our first assumption was incorrect. In fact, the time constant [16]_ of this circuit is much, much lower than it would be without the 10 K resistor.

.. [15] If you haven’t already, you will soon find out that every corporation wants you to sign away every idea you have or ever had as their intellectual property. Some day, those individuals who have all the good ideas must rise up and say, “Enough is enough!” After which we will all likely end up being consultants.

.. [16] If you want a more in-depth lesson on time constants, you will need to jump ahead a few chapters. For now, though, it is sufficient to understand the basic idea behind good ol’ Thevenin’s proposition.

There are other ways this theorem can be useful. Here is a case in point. You might have a circuit like the one shown in :ref:`Figure 2.24 <Figure 2.24>`.

.. _Figure 2.24:

    **FIGURE 2.25 AC switched power to an inductor with snubber.**

You need to switch AC power through this inductor (which was actually one winding of an AC motor in this case). Trouble is, when you let off the switch, a whole bunch of electrical noise is generated when this switch is opened. (We will discuss why when we cover magnetic fields later in the book.) A stan- dard way to deal with this situation is with an RC circuit commonly known as a snubber. The point of a snubber is to snub this voltage spike and dissipate it as heat on the resistor. This makes the most sense if it is across the inductor, as shown in :ref:`Figure 2.25 <Figure 2.25>`.

.. _Figure 2.26:

.. figure:: ./img/f2.26.png
    :scale: 50%
    :align: center

    **FIGURE 2.26 These are equivalent circuits when Thevenized.**

Now let’s apply Thevenin’s theorem to take a different look at this circuit, as shown in :ref:`Figure 2.26 <Figure 2.26>`. By shorting the AC voltage source, we quickly see that hooking the snubber up to the other side of the switch, to the AC hot line, would have exactly the same effect as hooking across the inductor. This fact once saved a company I worked for tens of thousands of dollars [17]_ using the alternate location of the snubber circuit. I would say that makes Thevenizing a pretty powerful tool, wouldn’t you?

.. [17] No, I didn’t get any bonus for my discovery and work in this case. Alas, that too is a sad fact of the corporate world we live and work in these days. On the flip side, the corporate world has made cartoons like Dilbert quite successful. Someday I predict corporations will come to realize that the best way to keep people happy while working hard is simply slipping them a few extra dollars.

.. admonition:: Thumb Rules

    - The basics are the most important!
    - For a basic understanding, think of impedance as similar to resistance at a given frequency.
    - ``V = I * Z``.
    - Voltage divider rule, ``Vo = Vi(Rg /(Rg + Rs))``.
    - A capacitor resists a change in voltage, but current can change immediately (the inverse of the inductor).
    - An inductor resists a change in current, but voltage can change immediately (the inverse of the capacitor).
    - A capacitor is to voltage as an inductor is to current.
    - Series resistors, series inductors, and parallel caps add up.
    - Parallel resistors, parallel inductors, and series caps use the product-over-the-sums, or the sum-of-the-inverse, rule.
    - When Thevenizing: short voltage sources, open current sources.
    - Consider the circuit from the output point of view.
    - Insight can be gained by Thevenizing a circuit.
