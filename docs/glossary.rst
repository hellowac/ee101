Glossary

我最喜欢的物理书部分之一就是封底内页。那里通常将所有精彩内容提炼为最基本的原理。如果不创建类似的部分，我就不能说这本书是完整的。

以下是一些你可能知道或可能不知道的术语——这些词语常用于电子学领域，但通常会让非工程师在不小心听到两个“电火花”工程师对话时露出困惑的表情。这些词语构成了一种秘密代码，通常为了提高效率而简化，有时也为了让老板听不懂，或至少让他猜不出你到底在说什么。这些词是我凭自己的秘密解码器随意挑选出来的，并经过判断哪些内容可以透露，而不至于被同行工程师吊起来打。

    One of my favorite areas in a physics book is the inside cover. It is where all the good stuff is distilled into the fundamentals. I couldn’t call this book complete without creating a similar section.

    The following are some terms that you may or may not know—words that are often used in the realm of electronics but that typically cause a look of confusion on any nonengineer who accidentally overhears a conversation between a couple of sparkies. These words constitute a secret code, usually short to be more efficient and sometimes intended to baffle the boss, or at least make him wonder what you are really talking about. They have been selected at will based on looking at my own secret decoder ring and deciding what was okay to reveal without risking lynching by my fellow engineers.

.. glossary::

    AC 
        交流电，或者说是来回切换方向的电流。这就是你家电线中送来的电，是普通插座提供的那种电。

        Alternating current, or current flow that switches back and forth. This is the type of power that comes in on the line to your house and is available at a common outlet.

    API 
        应用程序编程接口；其实就是一层一层的东西——程序跟程序对话，程序再跟程序对话，如此循环……要不就是一个简单的蛋糕。

        Application programming interface; it’s all layers, really—programs talking to programs talking to programs, and so on and so on and so on.... That or it is a simple cake.

    Back EMF
        EMF 指的是电动势，用来描述当你旋转直流永磁（PM）电机的电枢时产生的电压。这个术语也用于描述当你停止给电感器通电时，磁场塌陷所产生的接线端电压。由于两者都是由变化磁场产生的电压，所以这个用法是有道理的。

        EMF means electromotive force, which is used to describe the voltage generated when you spin the armature of a DC permanent magnet (PM) motor. The term is also used to describe the voltage generated at the connec- tions of an inductor when you stop pushing current through it and the mag- netic field collapses. Since they are both voltages caused by a changing magnetic field, it makes some sense.

    Bias 
        电子学中广泛使用的术语。偏置可以指施加在电路上的电压。例如，直流偏置或偏移是一种将交流信号从一个电平转换到另一个电平的方式，例如将电路或元件偏置到可预测行为的电平。比如你可以给晶体管的输入端加偏置。

        A widely used term in electronics. Bias can refer to the voltage applied to a circuit. For example, a DC bias or offset is a way of shifting an AC signal from one level to another, such as biasing a circuit or component to a level where you get a predictable behavior. You can bias the input of a transistor, for instance.

    BS 
        拜托，大家都知道 BS 是什么意思！

        Come on, everyone knows what BS means!

    BTW 
        顺便说一句；我之所以需要定义这个，是为了像我这样在没有手机和短信的年代长大的老家伙！

        By the way; the only reason I need to define this is for old farts like me who were raised without a cell phone and text messaging!

    Bulk cap 
        大容量电容器，通常是 1 μf 或更大，常见的有 100 μf 到 0.1 f。通常是电解电容器，不太适合高速频率，但电流承受能力很强。

        A large-value capacitor, usually 1 μf or bigger, commonly 100 μf to 0.1 f. Usually an electrolytic cap, not typically good at fast frequencies but has plenty of current capability.

    Cap 
        电容器，一种盘状结构，两个电极板中间夹着不导电的材料。电容器能够以电场的形式储存能量。

        Capacitor, a plate-like unit with a space of something that won’t conduct electricity between the plates. A cap has the capacity to store energy in the form of an electric field.

    Chip 
        集成电路（IC）的俚语。你经常会听到工程师把集成电路叫做芯片。这并不总意味着他们饿了想吃午饭！

        Slang for IC. You will often hear engineers refer to ICs as chips. It doesn’t always mean they are hungry for lunch!

    Current 
        描述电子运动的量，通常被视为“流动”。在水的类比中，电流就像是水的流量。安培是电路中电流的基本单位，常用符号是 I，偶尔也用 A。

        Describes the movement of electrons, commonly thought of as a flow. In the water analogy, this is the amount of water moving. Amp is the basic unit of current in an electrical circuit. Common symbols are I and, less often, A.

    DC 
        直流电，或只朝一个方向流动的电流。这就是电池提供的电流类型。计算机和大多数电子设备内部使用的电源类型也都是直流电。

        Direct current, or current flow that goes in only one direction. This is the type of power that comes from a battery. It is the type of power computers and most electronics use internally in their circuits.

    DCPM 
        直流永磁电机（direct current permanent magnet motor）的缩写。这种小家伙无处不在。

        Short for direct current permanent magnet motor. These little guys are everywhere.

    DMM 
        该死的万用表不读数；当工程师还没发现数字万用表的保险丝烧断时，常常会爆出这种咒骂。通常接下来就是去实验室找螺丝刀，因为你必须把整个万用表拆开才能换保险丝。

        Damn meter won’t measure; a cuss phrase often let loose when an engi- neer has yet to discover that the fuse is blown in his digital multimeter. Usually precedes stalking off to the lab to find a screwdriver since you have to tear the whole meter apart just to replace a fuse.

    Drain 
        通常指器件上的某个连接端，从这个端口“汲取”电流。

        Usually this is the connection on a device that “drains” current from whatever it is hooked up to.

    Drive 
        “驱动”某个部件意味着给它加电流和电压，让它按照你的意图工作。你驱动一个负载。如果被问到某个____能“驱动”什么，那意思就是它能提供多大电流/电压。

        To drive a part means to apply current and voltage to make the part do what you want. You drive a load. If asked what a ____ is capable of driving, it means how much can it sink and source.

    Duty cycle 
        开启时间与关闭时间的比例——换句话说，元件“当班”的时间占比。如果一个电机的占空比是 30%，那就表示它在 30% 的时间内工作，其余 70% 的时间处于关闭状态。

        A percentage of on-time versus off-time—how much time the component is on duty, so to speak. If a motor has a 30% duty cycle, that means it is being used 30% of the time; the other 70% of the time it is off.

    EPROM 
        早些时候我们的 PROM 只有一个 E，那时你得用紫外线来擦除它。哦对了，这个词的意思是“可擦除可编程只读存储器”。那 EPROM 技术上算是“容易晒伤”吗？

        Way back when our PROMs only had one E, you had to erase them with UV light. Oh yeah, it means erasable programmable read-only memory. Does that mean EPROMs technically were “easy to sunburn”?

    EMI 
        电磁干扰，是指干扰电路或电子系统运行的任何东西。有些迷信的工程师甚至会把它归因于超自然力量。

        Electromagnetic interference is any thing and every thing that interferes with an electric or electronic circuit. It is sometimes attributed to supernatural causes by superstitious engineers.

    EULA
        如果这个产品毁了你的数据，那大家都不能采取法律行动。如果你从没同意过 EULA 协议却拥有这本书，那，哇。我实在想不出什么俏皮话来形容了。

        Everyone is Unable to take Legal Action if this product destroys your data. If you have never agreed to a EULA and you own this book, well, wow. I am left at a complete loss trying to come up with a quirky remark.

    FAE
        相当精明的工程师（Fairly Astute Engineer）。我遇到的大多数 FAE 都挺聪明的，或者说我只是嫉妒他们拿了份轻松的工作？我也不确定。哦对了，它还代表现场应用工程师（Field Application Engineer）。

        Fairly Astute Engineer. Most FAEs I have met are pretty smart, or I am just jealous that they got the easy job? I’m not really sure. Oh yeah, it also means field application engineer.

    Flame mail
        有意伤害而非沟通的一封电子邮件。

        An email message that is sent with the intent to harm, not actually communicate.

    Flux
        焊剂，也叫松香，是一种酸性物质，可以单独使用，也可以掺在焊锡丝的芯部。加热时，它会清洁焊点，使焊锡更容易粘附。

        Flux, or resin, is an acid either applied separately or in the core of the solder. When heated, it cleans the joint to help the solder stick better.

    Forward bias
        指对二极管的偏置方式；在正向偏置下，二极管会导通电流。

        Refers to the biasing of a diode; when forward-biased, a diode passes current.

    Freewheel diode
        与电机并联接入的反向偏置二极管。它的作用是在磁场塌陷时捕获感应电流。

    Gate 
        一个反向偏置的二极管，与电机并联连接。它的作用是捕捉磁场崩溃时产生的感应电流。

        A reverse-biased diode hooked up in parallel with a motor. It is there to capture the inductive current generated as the magnetic field collapses.
        
        这个词有几种略微不同的含义：可以指一个逻辑元件，比如 NAND 门、NOR 门等；也可以指场效应晶体管（FET）上的一个连接端，它用于控制从漏极（drain）到源极（source）的电流流动。注意，这其实和畜栏中的“门”控制绵羊进出并没有太大区别——当然前提是你能把绵羊类比成电子。这是一个值得深入探索的有趣类比。

        This means a couple of slightly different things: a logic part, NAND gate, NOR gate, etc., or a connection on an FET that controls the current flow from drain to source. Note that it isn’t all that different from how a “gate” can keep or let out sheep in a corral—that is if you can compare sheep to electrons. Now there is an analogy that would be fun to explore. 

    Gnd, Vss
        电压参考点。通常你会把测量仪器的一根引线接到这个点上。也是从 Vcc 来的电流返回的地方（基于传统电流方向）。从电子流的角度看，这里是电子的发源地。

        The voltage reference point. Usually you connect one lead of a mea- suring instrument to this point. It is also the place all the current returns to (conventional flow again) that comes from Vcc. In electron flow terms, it is the point that spews forth electrons.

    Grok
        出自 Robert Heinlein 的小说《异乡异客》（Stranger in a Strange Land），是火星人的用词，意思是“彻底理解”，以最亲密的方式理解。

        Martian term in the book Stranger in a Strange Land by Robert Heinlein. It means to understand completely, in the most intimate way.

    Ground
        通常和电路地（circuit gnd）互换使用，但其实应区别对待。Ground 是你脚下的泥土，是你把一根大金属棒插进去并连接电路裸露金属（有时也是 gnd）的地方。这么做是为了安全。

        Often used interchangeably with circuit gnd, ground should be thought of differently. Ground is the dirt under your feet into which you drive a big stake and hook it up to the exposed metal (and sometimes the gnd) of your circuit. This is done for safety reasons.

    HW
        硬件的缩写。

        Abbreviation for hardware.

    IC
        集成电路，由多个二极管、晶体管和其他基本部件构成，蚀刻在硅基片上；可用于制造简单的开关，也可制造复杂的 Intel Pen-比上一代还酷-tium 芯片。

        Integrated circuit, a device that is made up of a combination of diodes and transistors and other basic parts etched into a silicon base; it’s used to make things as simple as switches and as complex as the Intel Pen-way-cooler-than- the-last-chip-tium in your PC.

    Impedance
        在许多公式中用 Z 表示。可以理解为考虑频率因素的电阻。常与电感和电容一起使用。

        Seen as a Z in many equations. Think of this as resistance that takes frequency into account. Used in conjunction with inductors and capacitors.

    Inductor
        最基本的形式是一圈线圈；它能以磁场的形式储存能量。当磁场变化时，会在导线中感应出电流。线圈能集中磁场。

        A coil of wire at its most fundamental; it can store energy in the form of a magnetic field. When a magnetic field changes, it induces current to flow in a wire. The coils concentrate the magnetic field.

    Iron
        焊锡工具，用于创建焊点。不，它不是用来熨衣服的！

        Soldering iron used to create solder junctions. No, you don’t want to iron your shirt with this device!

    ISA
        直觉信号分析（Intuitive Signal Analysis）——我自己发明的第一个缩写。如果我想成为知名的工程写作者，那得起码有一两个属于自己的缩写词。

        Intuitive signal analysis—the first acronym of my own invention. I figure if I ever want to be a famous engineering writer, I’d better have one or two acro- nyms to my name.

    JAVA
        一杯不错的咖啡，或者是一种酷到可以在咖啡馆里聊的编程语言。

        Nice cup of Joe, that or some programming language cool enough to be talked about at the coffeeshop.

    Junction
        两种半导体材料接触的地方。

        The place at which two semiconductors come together.

    Ladder logic
        一种编程方法或语言，其名称来源于描述程序的图表看起来像梯子。

        A type of programming method or language; its name comes from the ladder-like appearance of the diagram used to describe the program.

    Lead
        电子元件上的引脚，如 IC，用于将元件连接到 PCB。

        A pin on an electronic part, such as an IC, used to connect the part to the PCB.

    Leaky cap
        有漏电流的电容器，会允许一部分直流电通过。

        An imperfect capacitor that allows some amount of DC current to pass.

    Linear
        通常与电源或控制一起使用的术语。线性控制指的是持续地调节部件的电压。控制元件会根据两端电压和流过电流耗散能量。这种方式驱动负载效率通常较低，因为未被利用的能量变成了热量。

        A term often used in conjunction with supply or control. A linear con- trol is one that controls voltage to a part continuously. The part controlling this will dissipate energy based on the voltage across it and the current through it. It is typically an inefficient way to drive a load, since the power that is not used is turned into heat.

    Load
        需要电流和电压才能工作的部件。一个从 Vcc 到 gnd 回路中的电阻就是一个负载。

        Something that takes power, needing both current and voltage, to drive. A resistor that returns current from Vcc to gnd is a load.

    Magic smoke
        所有 IC 中让它们工作的“神奇烟雾”。你可不想让它跑出来！

        The stuff inside all ICs that makes them work. You don’t want to let it out!

    MAMA
        管理层总是在追着市场跑（Management Always Managing Around）——我自创的缩写词。如果你想在工程领域获得成功，你得造出一两个这样的缩写。又记我一个！

        Management always chasing the market around. My own personal acro- nym. If you want to be successful in the world of engineering, you have to invent an acronym or two. Chalk up another one for me!

    MCU
        微控制器，类似 CPU 但功能弱些，内建模块多些。

        Microcontroller, which is like a CPU but less powerful, with more stuff built in.

    NO, NC
        读作“nnnn ohhh”和“nnn seee”。这是用来表示开关或继电器连接状态的缩写术语。看吧，在工程里 NO 并不总是“否”的意思。

        Pronounced nnnn ohhh and nnn seee. A cryptic abbreviation for the typical state of a switch or relay connection. See, even in engineering, NO doesn’t always mean no.

    OPM
        别人的钱（Other People’s Money）；玩别人的钱总是比玩自己的钱更有趣。

        Other people’s money; it’s always more fun to play around with other peo- ple’s money than with your own.

    OS
        操作系统。

        Operating system.

    OTP
        一次性可编程（One-Time Programmable）。在 Flash 成为嵌入式微控制器的主流存储前，这种内存只能写入一次。现在还有些 OTP，但用的多半是高产量应用，甚至是掩膜式芯片。

        One-time programmable. Before Flash became the memory of choice in embedded micros, one chance was all you got. There are still a few OTPs out there, but you are probably in some really high volumes if you’re using these. It’s likely you are into masked parts as well.

    Pad
        不是你待着的地方！而是 PCB 上的一块裸铜区域，用于通过焊接将元件引脚连接到走线上。

        Not the place where you hang out! It’s the point on a PCB of bare copper where the leads of a part are connected by solder to a trace.

    PCB 或 PWB
        印刷电路板（Printed Circuit Board）或印刷布线板（Printed Wiring Board）。由复合材料制成，通常像板子一样坚硬，电路布局就在其上，连接起元器件。

        Printed circuit board or printed wiring board. A composite material, usually stiff like a board, on which a circuit is laid out, creating connections between components.

    PDA
        傻傻的助手（Pretty Dumb Assistant）。我宁可用 PDA 换一个真正活生生的助理！
        Pretty dumb assistant. I’d trade my PDA for a real live flesh-and-blood assis- tant any day!

    PLD
        可编程逻辑器件（Programmable Logic Device）。把一堆存储单元、成堆的逻辑门、大量复用器和配置方式全塞进一个 IC。结果就是一个能做各种状态机和逻辑处理的产品。你甚至可以用它们造微控制器，比如 FPGA 的兄弟产品。

        Programmable logic device. Take a whole bunch of memory cells, a slew of logic gates, a bunch of multiplexers, and a way to configure it all, and then cram everything into a single IC. At the end of all this, you get a product that can do a whole bunch of state machine and logic stuff. You can even make MCUs out of them, as in sister products such as the FPGA.

    PM
        永磁体（Permanent Magnet）。

        Permanent magnet.

    Pointy hair
        感谢 Scott Adams 的贡献，现在我们可以用这个词称呼我们的老板了。

        We have Scott Adams to thank for this unique term, which we can now use to refer to our bosses.

    Power
        电压与电流的组合。这就是让你家灯泡亮起来的东西。功率的单位是瓦特，符号为 W。瓦特可以转换为马力（HP）；1 马力等于 746 瓦。还有个常见的近似符号是 VA（伏安），常用于交流电源系统中，仅当电压和电流同相时才等于瓦特。

        The combination of voltage and current. This is what turns the lights on in your house. The unit for power is the watt. The common symbol is W. Watts can be converted to horsepower (HP); it takes 746’W to make 1’HP. Another symbol you might see that is loosely related to watts is VA, or volt amps. The symbol is generally used in power supply systems to refer to AC power; it is equivalent to watts only when the current and voltage match phases.

    Power component
        指处理大电流或高电压的元件。至于“大”与“高”是相对的——只要电流大到要考虑发热、电压高到触摸就不是小刺激，就可以算在此类中。

        A term commonly used to refer to parts that handle a large amount of current or high voltage. Of course, the words large and high are relative. It means a current large enough so that you need to worry about things like heat and voltage, and high enough so that it will do more than tickle a little if you touch it.

    Power device
        通常指 FET、晶体管等半导体器件，它们将低功率输入信号放大为高功率输出。功率器件在设计中必须小心处理，以避免过热。通常它们有一个面是设计用来与散热片结合的，以帮助散热。

        A common term used to refer to semiconductor devices, such as FETs and transistors, that take a small low-power input signal and amplify it into a high-power signal. Power devices usually need to be meticulously handled in your design to avoid overheating. They often have a surface that is designed to be coupled to a heat sink to manage the power dissipated as they operate.

    Pull-up
        从输入线到 Vcc 的一个电阻。如果没有其他电流流动，它会把该节点的电压拉升到 Vcc。

        A resistor from an input line to Vcc. In the absence of any other current flow, it “pulls” the voltage at that node to Vcc.

    Pull-down
        从输入线到地的一个电阻。如果没有其他电流流动，它会把该节点的电压拉低到地。

        A resistor from an input line to gnd. In the absence of any other current flow, it “pulls” the voltage at that node to gnd.

    PWM
        脉冲宽度调制（Pulse Width Modulation）。一种用数字方式控制电压的方法。开启与关闭的时间比例决定施加在负载上的功率。

        Pulse width modulation. A digital method of controlling a voltage level. The percentage of time-on versus time-off determines the amount of power applied to the load.

    R
        读作“arrrrr”，比如“这个小家伙的 arrr 是多少？”它表示电阻——与电压成比例地抵抗电流的东西。是欧姆定律中的 R。

        Pronounced arrrrr, as in “What is the arrr of that puppy?”; it means resistance-something that resists the flow of current proportional to the voltage. It is the R in Ohm’s Law.

    Rail
        输出电压能达到的极限。顶端电压是正向最大电压，底端电压是最低电压。这不一定等于电源电压。有些器件不能让输出达到 Vcc 或 gnd。当输出达到这些极限时，通常称为“打 rail”。

        The voltage limit to which an output can swing. The top rail is the highest positive voltage it can get to, and the bottom rail is the lowest voltage it can get to. This is not necessarily the same as the power supply. Some devices cannot get the output to reach Vcc or gnd in the circuit. When the output is at these limits, it is common to say it is “railed.”

    RC
        无线遥控（Radio Control），一个花钱的好爱好。也表示电阻/电容电路。

        Radio control. A fun hobby that you can dump a lot of money into. Also means resistor/capacitor circuit.

    Rectify
        整流，把交流电变成直流电的过程。

        Rectify or rectification is the process of turning AC power into DC power.

    Reverse bias
        偏置的一种特殊形式，通常用于描述二极管。当二极管（或器件中的二极管结构）被反向偏置时，它会阻断电流。

        A specific case of biasing, usually referring to a diode. When a diode (or diode-type junction in a component) is reverse-biased, the diode blocks current flow.

    RSP
        非常聪明的人（Really Smart Person）。我喜欢跟非常聪明的人聊天——前提是我能听懂他们在说什么！

        Really smart person. I love to talk to really smart people; that is, when I can understand what they are saying!

    Sink
        不是厨房水槽，不过它确实有点像排水口；通常用于句子“它能 sink 多少？”意思是这个部件可以承受多大电流进入地线。

        No, not the kitchen sink, but it does act a little like a drain; generally used in a phrase such as “How much can that sink?” It means how much current is capable of going into ground through that part.

    SNL
        《周六夜现场》（Saturday Night Live）。节目总是挺精彩的。

        Saturday Night Live. There is always something good on SNL.

    Solder
        用于创建电气连接的材料。加热后形成焊点。

        A material used to make electrical connections. It is heated to create that connection.

    Source
        常出现在“它能 source 多少？”这样的句子中。意思是这个部件能输出多大电流。sink 和 source 都基于传统的从正到负的电流流动术语。

        A term often used in a phrase such as “How much can that source?” It means how much current is capable of coming out of that part. Both sink and source assume conventional current flow terminology from positive to negative.

    Sparky
        Darren 世界中广泛使用的电气工程师俚语。（我们试图把“wrench”这个词分给机械工程师，但就是不太顺口。）

        A widely used slang term to refer to an electrical engineer, at least in the world of Darren. (We tried to assign the term “wrench” to the MEs, but it just doesn’t have the same ring to it.)
        
    State machine
        一种基于输入状态决定输出的计算设备。更复杂的形式还会将输出反馈给输入，或者记忆某些输入。

        A computing device that looks at the state of the inputs to determine the output. More complex forms of this device feedback outputs to the input and/or maintain memory of certain inputs.

    SW
        软件的缩写。

        Abbreviation for software.

    
    Switcher
        线性控制或电源的“堂兄”。开关控制是数字性质的，系统中某处有个开关，用来周期性地通断负载电源。开与关的时间比例叫占空比，以百分比表示。负载中通常会有电感或电容器件，用于滤除开关频率，使施加在负载上的电压或电流平稳。

        A cousin to the linear control or supply. The switching control is digital in nature. Somewhere in the system is a switch that turns on and off cycling power to the load. The amount of time-on versus time-off is called the duty cycle; it is defined as a percentage. Often there is an inductive or capacitive component in or attached to the load that filters the frequency of the switching device to smooth out the voltage or current to the load.

    Switch mode
        对器件（如晶体管或 FET）的数字控制。部件处于完全导通或完全关闭状态，就像一个开关——因此得名“开关模式控制”。在开关电源等应用中使用这类器件能提高效率，因为器件不处于线性区域时，产生的热量更少。

        The digital control of a device such as a transistor or FET, for example. The part is either turned all the way on or off, like a switch— hence, switch mode control. Using a device like this in applications, such as a switching power supply, helps make them more efficient because less heat is created when a part is not in the linear region of operation.

    Threshold
        在电子学中，当电压超过这个电平时，会改变逻辑电路的输出状态，从 1 变 0，或反之。

        In electronics, a voltage level that, when crossed, changes the output state of a logic circuit from 1 to 0, or vice versa.
    
    Tinning
        指的是给焊接头或导线涂上一层焊锡，以便传热。

        Refers to applying solder to the tip of an iron or to a wire to help heat transfer.

    Trace
        PCB 上你看到的小绿线。它们是铜制的，是连接元件的“电线”。Trace 也可以指一种软件调试方法。

        The little green lines you see on a PCB. They are made of copper and are the wires that connect the parts. Trace can also refer to a method of trouble- shooting software.

    Vcc
    Vdd
    电源
    电压源
        电路中的电压源。按照传统电流方向的说法，这是所有正电洞的来源；按照电子流动的说法，这是所有电子试图到达的地方。

        The voltage source in the circuit. In conventional flow terms, it is the place all the positive holes come from. In electron flow terms, it is the place all the electrons try to get to.

    Via 
        PCB 上的一个孔，在一些 PCB 上，这个孔内壁覆有铜。它的作用有两个：一是连接顶层走线和底层走线；二是作为元件引脚插入并焊接到 PCB 的位置。

        A hole in a PCB that on some PCBs is coated with copper. It is used for two reasons: either to create a connection between a top trace and a bottom trace or to create a hole in which a part lead can be inserted and soldered to the PCB.

    Voltage 
        可用电子的电势。如果用水来类比，这是驱动电流移动的压力。电压的单位是伏特，常用符号是 V 和 E。

        The potential of the available electrons. Using the water analogy, this is the pressure the current is under to move. The unit for voltage is the volt. Common symbols are V and E.

    Voltage drop 
        测量某个元件（如电阻）两端的电压。这不是“掉进桶里”的“drop”，而是技术术语，表示一个元件两端测得的电压差。（由于测量是相对的，你总可以换一下万用表探头让它看起来像是“电压下降”。）如果电压降增大或减小，表示该元件两端电压变化的绝对值或幅度正在增加或减少。

        The voltage measured across a component, such as a resistor. Not a “drop” in a bucket or anything like that; it’s simply techno-speak indicat- ing the difference in voltage as measured from one side of a component to another. (Since what you measure is relative, you can always switch the meter leads to make it look like a “drop” in voltage.) If a voltage drop increases or decreases, this means the absolute value or magnitude of the change in voltage across the component is increasing or decreasing.

    Zebra 
        这本书里没用过这个词，但我非得在词汇表里凑一个“Z”词才算完整！等下……我本该用齐纳二极管（Zener）的，那可是个有趣的电工词！试试看，现在快点连说三遍“Zener”，我敢打赌你会笑出来！

        Not used anywhere in the book, but I just had to have a ‘Z’ term in my glossary to be complete! Wait a minute... I should have used Zener, now there is a sparky word that is fun to say, try it now, say Zener three times real fast, I bet it makes you smile!
